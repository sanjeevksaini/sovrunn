# Federation Capability Specification

Document:
  ID: federation-specification
  Title: Federation Capability Specification
  Parent: capability-specification
  Owner: SDE Specification Layer
  Layer: Specification
  Type: Capability Contract
  Version: 1.0
  Status: Draft

Purpose:
  - Define the Federation capability category for Sovrunn Data Engine
  - Define capability requirements, support levels, validation rules, and failure behavior
  - Provide Planning, Protocol Plugin, Engine Plugin, and Capability Registry with a common contract

Definition:
  Federation capability defines how SDE represents operations that span multiple downstream engines, datastores, shards, regions, or execution targets while preserving semantic, policy, and failure boundaries.

Scope:
  In Scope:
    - Capability identity
    - Capability requirements
    - Capability support levels
    - Capability declaration
    - Planning validation
    - Engine Plugin validation
    - Protocol Plugin interaction
    - Error Model behavior

  Out of Scope:
    - Downstream datastore native implementation
    - Engine Plugin implementation code
    - Protocol Plugin implementation code
    - Datastore lifecycle management
    - Infrastructure provisioning

Capability Identity:
  Category: Federation
  Canonical Identifier Prefix: sde.capability.federation

Capability Requirements:
  - Multi-engine execution support
  - Multi-datastore query support
  - Cross-target planning support
  - Cross-target result aggregation
  - Cross-target transaction constraints
  - Remote predicate pushdown support
  - Partial failure behavior
  - Cross-target policy enforcement
  - Data locality constraints

Support Levels:
  Required:
    Meaning: Request execution MUST fail if the capability is unavailable.

  Optional:
    Meaning: Request execution MAY continue without the capability when semantics remain valid.

  Preferred:
    Meaning: Planning SHOULD use the capability when available.

  Unsupported:
    Meaning: Selected Protocol Plugin, Engine Plugin, or Downstream Datastore does not support the capability.

  Emulated:
    Meaning: Capability may be provided by SDE or plugin behavior only when semantic equivalence is guaranteed.

Declaration Rules:
  - Capability support MUST be declared explicitly.
  - Capability version MUST be declared.
  - Support level MUST be declared.
  - Unsupported combinations MUST be declared.
  - Known semantic gaps MUST be declared.
  - Safe downgrade behavior MUST be declared when allowed.
  - Capability declaration MUST be approved before Data Plane use.

Planning Rules:
  - Planning MUST validate required Federation capabilities before Execution Plan emission.
  - Planning MUST use approved Capability Registry metadata.
  - Planning MUST use approved Protocol Plugin and Engine Plugin capability metadata.
  - Planning MUST reject unsupported required capability.
  - Planning MUST NOT silently downgrade required capability.
  - Planning MUST NOT invent capability support.
  - Planning MUST encode capability decisions in Execution Plan where execution behavior depends on them.

Execution Rules:
  - Federated execution MUST be explicit in Execution Plan.
  - Planning MUST validate all required target capabilities.
  - Cross-target policy constraints MUST be enforced.
  - Data locality constraints MUST be respected.
  - Partial target failure MUST be explicit.
  - Federation MUST NOT silently weaken transaction semantics.
  - Result aggregation MUST preserve SIR intent.

Failure Rules:
  - No compatible target set MUST produce Error Model.
  - Required target unavailable MUST produce Error Model unless safe degraded execution exists.
  - Cross-target policy denial MUST produce Error Model.
  - Federated partial failure MUST preserve target-level failure context safely.

Security Rules:
  - Capability validation MUST preserve tenant isolation.
  - Capability metadata MUST NOT expose raw secrets.
  - Capability failure details MUST redact unsafe internal or downstream-native details.
  - Capability validation MUST fail closed when security impact is unknown.
  - Capability use MUST respect policy constraints.

Compatibility Rules:
  - Capability version compatibility MUST follow Versioning Specification.
  - Breaking semantic change requires MAJOR version change.
  - Optional field addition is allowed only with safe absence behavior.
  - Deprecated capability versions MUST remain documented.
  - Removed capability versions MUST fail deterministically when requested.

Invariants:
  - Federation capability support is explicit.
  - Required Federation capability is validated before execution.
  - Unsupported required Federation capability prevents Execution Plan emission.
  - Capability downgrade is never silent.
  - Capability emulation is never implicit.
  - Capability metadata is governed by SDE Control Plane.
  - SDE Data Plane consumes approved capability metadata only.
